# Fantasy name generator
Fantasy authors often use similar names—Xaden, Jaden, Caden. I’ve written a "creative" fantasy name generator in Python that changes the first letter based on whether it's a consonant or vowel. The user gets 3 suggestions and a default if none are approved. I'm now working on implementing it with Django.
